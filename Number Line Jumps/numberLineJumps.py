# Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/kangaroo/problem
# You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given 
# two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).
# The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
# The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
# You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show.
# If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.
# Ex: 
# x1 = 2
# v1 = 1
# x2 = 1
# v2 = 2
# After one jump, they are both at x = 3, (x1 + v1 = 2 + 1, x2 + v2 = 1 + 2), so the answer is YES

// Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/migratory-birds/problem
// Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most
// frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.
// Example: There are two each of types 1 and 2, and one sighting of type 3. Pick the lower of the two types seen twice: type 1.

# Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/grading/problem
# HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
# Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
# Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
# Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
# If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
# If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
# Examples:
# grade = 84 round to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
# grade = 29 do not round(result is less than 40)
# grade = 57 do not round(60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
# Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

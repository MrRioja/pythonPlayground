# Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/three-month-preparation-kit-camel-case/problem
# Camel Case is a naming style common in many programming languages. In Java, method and variable names typically
# start with a lowercase letter, with all subsequent words starting with a capital letter (example: startThread).
# Names of classes follow the same pattern, except that they start with a capital letter (example: BlueCar).
# Your task is to write a program that creates or splits Camel Case variable, method, and class names.
